# Score-Board
 Frontend application based on REACT

 * Start a new game, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard.
This should capture following parameters: a. Home team b. Away team

 * Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away
team score

 * Finish game currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard
